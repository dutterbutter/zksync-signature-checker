# zkSync Hardhat project

This project was scaffolded with [zksync-cli](https://github.com/matter-labs/zksync-cli).

## Project structure

- `/contracts`: smart contracts.
- `/deploy`: deployment and contract interaction scripts.
- `/test`: test files
- `hardhat.config.ts`: configuration file.

## Commands

- `yarn hardhat compile` will compile the contracts.
- `yarn run deploy` will execute the deployment script `/deploy/deploy-greeter.ts`. Requires [environment variable setup](#environment-variables).
- `yarn run greet` will execute the script `/deploy/use-greeter.ts` which interacts with the Greeter contract deployed.
- `yarn test`: run tests. **Check test requirements below.**

Both `yarn run deploy` and `yarn run greet` are configured in the `package.json` file and run `yarn hardhat deploy-zksync`.

### Environment variables

In order to prevent users to leak private keys, this project includes the `dotenv` package which is used to load environment variables. It's used to load the wallet private key, required to run the deploy script.

To use it, rename `.env.example` to `.env` and enter your private key.

```
WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY=123cde574ccff....
```

### Local testing

run 

```
yarn local-node
```

and in a separate terminal

```
yarn test
```
